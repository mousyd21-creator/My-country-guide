          marks the earliest chapter of French history, when the land now <br>
           known as France was called Gaul. Inhabited by Celtic tribes, it was conquered by Julius Caesar <br>
           in the 1st century BCE and became part of the Roman Empire. Roman rule brought new cities, <br> roads, and culture, blending Roman and Celtic traditions. This period laid the foundation <br>
           for the future development of France .Over time, the influence of Roman law, language, <br>and architecture shaped the identity of what would later become France.
